"""Contains code that may still be useful.

* classify_profiles.py: original code used as standalone script for doing classification.
* egu_poster_figs.py: figures for EGU poster.
* mesoscale_talk_figs.py: figures for mesoscale talks.

Last two in particular might have useful code in them, first is kept mainly for posterity.
I know it would all be in the git archive but they're easier to look at in working copy.
